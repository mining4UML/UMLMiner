# UML Miner - To make UML diagrams mining possible

UML Miner is a Visual Paradigm plug-in that makes possible mining all the UML diagrams realized in real-time. It produces  a Log Event written in the XES format that can be readily explored and analyzed upon the generation. The XES standard defines a grammar for a tag-based language whose aim is to provide designers of information systems with a unified and extensible methodology for capturing systems behaviors by means of event logs and event streams is defined in the XES standard.
- UML Miner supports the [Declare Miner](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0306437916306615?via%3Dihub) and [MINERful](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2629447) techniques to process discovery.
- UML Miner supports the [Declare Analyzer](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0957417416304390?via%3Dihub) and the [Declare Replayer](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-642-32885-5_6) methods to conformance checking. The conformance can be explored either by trace or by constraint.

For each "Visual Paradigm" project, UML Miner creates a unique log. A log is made up of all the working sessions on that project.
A working session of a Project represents all the modeling events made across all the UML diagrams employed between an opening and the corresponding closure of the project.

## Installation
UML Miner comes as a zip file. To install it in Visual Paradigm it only necessary to select  "Help > Install Plugin" from the application toolbar. 

## Development
The development of UML Miner has been started by Ardimento Pasquale and was later continued by Pasquale Ardimento and Vito Alessandro Carella.
Currently is still under development (01st June 2023).
