UML Miner - To make UML diagrams mining possible

UML Miner is a Visual Paradigm plug-in that makes possible mining all the UML diagrams realized in real-time. It produces  a Log Event written in the XES format that can be readily explored and analyzed upon the generation.  The XES standard defines a grammar for a tag-based language whose aim is to provide designers of information systems with a unified and extensible methodology for capturing systems behaviors by means of event logs and event streams is defined in the XES standard.
- UML Miner supports the Declare Miner and MINERful techniques to process discovery.
- UML Miner supports the Declare Analyzer and the Declare Replayer methods to conformance checking. The conformance can be explored either by trace or by constraint.

UML Miner comes as a zip file. To install it in Visual Paradigm it only necessary to select  "Help > Install Plugin" from the application toolbar.

Currently is still under development (01st June 2023).
